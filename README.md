# 📖 Story Books

A full-stack CRUD web app where users can write, manage, and share personal stories. Built while following a guided tutorial to deepen my understanding of **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and several new libraries.

## 🚀 What It Does

- **User Authentication**  
  Secure login using **Google OAuth 2.0** powered by **Passport.js**.

- **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Stories**  
  Users can:
  - Write stories using **CKEditor** with rich text support.
  - Choose to publish stories **publicly** or keep them **private**.
  - Edit or delete their own stories.

- **Public Stories Feed**  
  A public page showing all public stories from every user.

- **User Dashboards**  
  Each user has a dashboard displaying their personal public and private stories.

- **Story Authors & User Pages**  
  Each story displays the author's name. Clicking it loads a page with all stories written by that user.

## 📚 What I Learned

This project wasn’t just about code — it was about structuring an app like a pro. Here’s what I leveled up on:

- **New Packages & Tools**
  - 📦 `express-handlebars` for templating.
  - 🔐 `passport.js` for authentication.
  - 📅 `moment.js` for date formatting.
  - 📝 `method-override` for using PUT and DELETE in forms.
  - ✨ `dotenv` for environment variables.

- **Google OAuth Authentication**  
  Mastered integrating **Google login** through **Passport.js** and securing app routes.

- **App Structure & Separation of Concerns**  
  Learned how to keep things clean and organized:
  - Routes in their own folders.
  - Config files separated.
  - Models structured.
  - Middlewares properly placed.

- **Working with CKEditor**  
  Implemented a WYSIWYG editor for better story writing experience.

- **Folder Structure Best Practices**  
  Connected the pieces while making sure things stay tidy and scalable.
